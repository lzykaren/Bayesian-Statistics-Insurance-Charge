# Bayesian-Statistics-Insurance-Charge

Hello! 

This is Ziyan Lin, a graduate student from Johns Hopkins University, majoring in applied math and statistics.

In this repository, there is a group project developed by Bayesian statistics. Group members are Mingzhong Gao, Chenyang Li, Ziyan Lin, Han Wang, and Weizhuo Wang.

The purpose of this project is to analyze and predict relation between insurance charge and 6 predictive features, age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, and region. The dataset contains more than one thousand observations, and it is retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance/data. 

The assumption of Bayesian approach is a linear regression relationship between the target and variables. Two different priors, conjugate and non-conjugate prior, are set to obtain corresponding posterior distributions. And then, Gibbs Sampling is implemented to sample parameters. Although both results converge in the end, conjugate prior performs better than non-conjugate one.

Classification is also involved in this project, since insurance company usually provide different categories of insurance. Therefore, classification methods are useful in this project as well. Methods are Random Forest, Logistic Regression, QDA, LDA, Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, and KNN.

This repository contains all code for [Conjugate part](), [Gibbs part](), [classification part](https://github.com/lzykaren/Bayesian-Statistics-Insurance-Charge/blob/master/Bayesian%20Project%20Classification%20Code.ipynb), and one [final report](https://github.com/lzykaren/Bayesian-Statistics-Insurance-Charge/blob/master/Bayesian%20Final%20Report.pdf). If you have any question or suggestion, please feel free to contact me. Thank you very much.
